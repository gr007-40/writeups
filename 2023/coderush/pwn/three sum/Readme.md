# Three Sum

#### tags: `binary exploitation` `integer overflow`

## Description

I hope ye'all have done [this](https://play.picoctf.org/events/72/challenges/challenge/382) challenge where you sum up two numbers. But don't you think that `three` makes a lot more sense than `two`? We will make things right by adding up three numbers to make it awe sum.

## Solution

We are given a binary. Let's load it into Ghidra.

The program does nothing out of ordinary. It takes Three integers as input, adds them up and checks if the result has caused any overflow or not with the `overflew` function. The way it checks for overflow is by the following condition: `(((n1 < 1) || (n2 < 1)) || (n3 < 1)) || (0 < sum)`. So, by this function, overflow occurs if either the sum is less than 0 or any one of the numbers is less than 1. By sane logic it might be hard to get that how can you add three poisitive integers greater than 0 but still get a sum greater than zero that is somehow less than any one of the integers that were added. But if we talk about computers, `meh`.

Integers are 32 bit long. if the result is to be greater than zero then the `sign` bit needs to be zero in the result. Now, how can we do it?
Let's look at the following example for 8 bit signed integer:

`0b01100000` => `n1`

`0b01100000` => `n2`

`0b01000000` => `n3`

`0b00000000` => `sum`

how this happens? well the original result would be: `0b100000000` in `9` bit. But the extra 1 has to be removed. Now, we are left with only 0 as sum. Thus having sum less than any of the given numbers and also the sum being greater than 0. The same logic applies for 32bit integers. So, to get 0 as sum, we need any three positive numbers whose sum add up to at least `2<<32 + 1` as the sum needs to be greater than zero.
